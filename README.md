# gfw_keyword_updater

*This program requires Python 3 and UNIX environment.*

Project intended to update the list of keywords blocked by GFW.

To see a list of command line options for the script, run:
```
python main.py --help
```

You might need to use `python3` instead of python if your environment uses `python2` by default.

Keywords used for this project are in the file `english_words_list.txt`. Words in this list were obtained from [here.](https://github.com/jasonqng/chinese-keywords)

The results of our preliminary run of the script are in the directory [`outputs/`](https://github.com/arjunkrishnababu96/gfw_keyword_updater/tree/master/outputs).
